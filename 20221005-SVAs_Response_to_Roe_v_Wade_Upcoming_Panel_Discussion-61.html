<div dir="ltr">SVA’s Response to Roe v. Wade: We Are Here to Support You<br><br>On Friday, June 24, 2022, The Supreme Court overturned the 50-year decision known as Roe v. Wade, which protected a woman’s constitutional right to abortion. The Dobbs decision has provided individual states the freedom to determine how they will proceed with their abortion laws. In New York, abortion has been legal since 1970—three years before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion throughout the U.S. The right is currently codified in New York State law.<br><br> As an institution tasked with protecting the health and wellness of all of our community members, this decision has not contravened our ability to do so. We at SVA understand that this decision has affected many of you, and many others, deeply. We want to let you know and remind you that we are here for you and that we will continue to support the rights of women and those who can become pregnant.<br><br>The state and federal response to the Dobbs decision is ongoing and our own response continues to evolve as well. Student Health and Counseling Services continues to closely monitor how this will affect our community and will continue to provide resources that can assist you with understanding more about your reproductive rights. Please know that Student Health and Counseling Services is here to offer support, counseling and resources for all students who seek it.  <br><br>In addition, we will be holding an accessible discussion on Wednesday, October 12, at 3:30pm with two representatives from Planned Parenthood that will provide an opportunity for the SVA community to hear from experts that focus on various aspects of the decision.
