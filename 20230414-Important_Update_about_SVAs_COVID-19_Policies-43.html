<div dir="ltr">Good afternoon,<div><br></div><div>I hope this email finds you well.<div><br></div><div>On May 11, 2023, the federal government will no longer classify COVID-19 as a public health emergency, because of a significant decline in daily reported COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths nationwide. These declines have been mirrored in New York City, as you have likely seen in news reports and in our weekly reporting of case rates in SVA Today and on our website.</div><div><br></div><div>With this new phase, I am pleased to announce that SVA is making some important changes to our COVID-19 vaccination policy effective <b>May 11, 2023</b>:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Vaccination Requirement and Cleared4</b></div><div><br></div><div>SVA will end its requirement for the COVID-19 vaccination and booster. You will no longer need to provide a daily health attestation through a link to Cleared4. However, to enter SVA buildings, you must continue to swipe your SVA ID at the security desks.<br><br><b>Visitors and Vendors<br></b><br>Visitors and vendors will still need to sign in using the SPLAN system and show proof of ID in order to enter any SVA building. However, they will no longer need to upload proof of vaccination and booster. If you have a visitor, or group of visitors, please provide their name(s) to your building’s security desk in advance of their arrival. The use of Eventbrite to pre-register people for events and exhibitions will be left to the discretion of the host department and the Galleries.<br><br><b>Staying Safe<br></b><br>Despite these changes, we remain vigilant about making sure the College remains a safe and healthy place. We still recommend getting COVID-19 boosters and an annual flu shot. If you are sick, stay home. If you test positive for COVID-19, you still must report by emailing <a href="mailto:studenthealthalert@sva.edu" target="_blank">studenthealthalert@sva.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:employee-health-alert@sva.edu" target="_blank">employee-health-alert@sva.edu</a>. The isolation procedures we have in place at residence halls will remain until further notice. And masks are always welcome at SVA.<br><br>As we approach the end of the 2022-2023 year, I wish to thank you again for your cooperation, patience and diligence in helping to keep our community safe and healthy. I wish you all the best as the year comes to a close.<br><br>David Rhodes<br><br>President<div class="gmail-yj6qo"></div><div class="gmail-adL"><br></div></div></div><div><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><pre style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;word-spacing:0px;white-space:pre-wrap;color:rgb(136,136,136)" cols="72"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="#888888"><img src="http://www.sva.edu/email/signature.gif" height="38" width="96"><br><br></font></span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div>
