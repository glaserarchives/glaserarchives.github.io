His paintings have been exhibited extensively in galleries around the world, and he has had 12 one person museum exhibitions across the country. His printed work has appeared in Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, Graphis, Interview, Harper’s, and Mother Jones to name a few, and he has created many memorable book covers including the works of Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, Ann Patchett, Anne Tyler, and the American Illustration annual.
